<meta name="description" content="Sections in this article Introduction Design Guidelines Design Warranty Release Process Third Party Applications Support Contact Warranty and liability disclaimer Deliverables summary Introduction The Ledger Manager is the service which centralizes the distribution of BOLOS &lt;/b_introduction&gt; applications on Ledger devices. It is the place where both Ledger’s apps and third party apps are distributed to users. This document aims at explaining the procedure for a third party app to be released on the Ledger Manager. &lt;figcaption aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;The Ledger Manager&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; First, let’s see the typical end-to-end architecture of a BOLOS application, in the case of an app for a cryptocurrency: End-to-end architecture of a BOLOS application In this example, 3 pieces of software are required: A BOLOS application, written in C, running on a Ledger device The companion app, with business logic and typically a GUI, running on a computer or a phone connected to the Ledger device A transaction explorer that interfaces between the front-end and the cryptocurrency daemon, running either locally (in the case of a full node) or remotely (light wallet) If you’re not developing an app adding support for a cryptocurrency, then you can ignore the 3rd piece. Depending on your use case, the companion app might be a simple daemon or a command line tool, without a GUI. The companion app should always be compatible with Windows, MacOS and Linux Ledger&#39;s main companion app: the Ledger Live When these pieces are ready for deployment, they must be sent to Ledger for a security review. One of the things we’re going to do is review the security of the BOLOS application code, and check that it functions as intended in conjunction with its companion app. Here is a non-exhaustive list of what we’re looking at during the review process: Backdoors Buffer overflows Correct use of the device (for example, minimizing `NVRAM wearing `) Correct use of the SDK Application stability, correct handling of errors Correct usability (see Design Guidelines) Review time depends on Ledger’s available resources and code complexity. The more unique and complex the code, the longer the review. Please note that forks of supported BOLOS apps will require a new review. The decision to reject or revoke an app is at Ledger’s sole discretion. We will make our best efforts to provide a rationale for such decisions. Upon fixing identified issues, app authors will be allowed to re-submit their apps. A new all-in-one native app called Ledger Live has been released on the 9th of July, 2018. This new platform will be open to pull requests for adding support for new cryptocurrencies in the coming months, it is not available yet. Currently, your best shot is to build your own companion app with its own backend. It is less convenient for users than a full integration to Ledger Live, but on the other hand, it gives you more freedom on the design of the interface you want users to see, and the way it will be implemented (Web app? Native app? It’s up to you!). Design Guidelines The design of your device app will be added to our website to inform that your app is available. In that respect, we thank you to provide us with the design in a format and with measurements that shall meet the criteria communicated by our team. There are 2 mandatory icons that should be provided for Ledger to release an app: The Device icon, displayed on the Nano S dashboard The Manager icon, displayed in the Manager application list Below are the Adobe Illustrator templates for such icons, please respect their guidance. The color palette for Blue icons shall contain 16 colors maximum The icon file shall not contain any alpha channel In order to blend well with the Blue’s Dashboard background, the 4 rounded white corners of the blue icon shall be set to this RGB value: #F9F9F9 (and not #FFFFFF) Nano X icons must be 14x14 px in size. Developers can create their Nano X icons from the 16x16 px Nano S one with the following command on Linux (it first requires to install the package imagemagick): convert nanos_app_&lt;token&gt;.gif -crop 14x14+1+1 +repage -negate nanox_app_&lt;token&gt;.gif Click on each image to download the corresponding .ai file, and fill them directly before sending them back. They should correspond to the icons used to compile your app. Device icon template (click to access Illustrator file) Manager icon template (click to access Illustrator file) Most of the time, Bolos apps expose few functionalities to the user. However, despite this simplicity, it is still challenging to build a user-friendly interface, because of the few inputs (only 2 buttons !) and also because of the screen size which offer only 128*32 pixels. Ledger provides some guidance to avoid third party developers to reinvent the wheel. Note See the `BAGL Toolkit&lt;/u_display_management&gt;` for more information on the BOLOS Application Graphics Library technical details. Even though the screen is small, you don’t want to bloat it with plenty of tiny text to fit everything in a single time. Instead, multiple successives screens are the way to go, with a configurable time interval between each screen switch. Doing this allows you to split and segment the information to display. It is also a good practice to inform the user of what is the kind of information currently displayed, by giving it a title. In some cases, even when the information is segmented by type, there won’t be enough space for it to fit entirely on screen. Rather than splitting this information in multiple screens, it is better to use automatic scrolling display. Here is an example that sums it up: Example: transaction confirmation screen On this example two pieces of information are shown: an amount of bitcoins, and a destination address. The two screens are alternating periodically until the user validates or cancel. A title is present to describe each information. For the too-long-to-display destination address, the automatic scrolling is used. A few graphical pointers (glyphs) help users to make a link between the right and left buttons and their effects. There are four principal functions fulfilled by pressing buttons: Making a binary choice for a question asked by the device (1 button) Moving in a menu (1 button) Selecting a menu entry (2 buttons) Proceeding with a disclaimer (2 buttons) To propose a binary choice to the user, 2 glyphs representing the 2 choices should be placed on each side of the screen (a cross symbol to cancel and a validation symbol to accept). You can display a question and relevant information in between the glyphs, like in the upper example. To move inside a menu, be it vertical or horizontal, the same technique is applied with different glyphs. We recommend using arrows: up and down for a vertical menu, left and right for a horizontal one). Example use of arrows in an horizontal menu Example use of arrows in a vertical menu Once positioned on the right menu entry, the user can select the entry by pressing both buttons. This potential action is not represented by glyphs. Same goes when going through a set of disclaimer screens: only text is displayed, and the user goes to the next part by pressing both buttons. This is a consistent behavior across the device, so you can assume that users are used to it. It should feel obvious when the user has to press two buttons to go through something in your app. Ledger does not impose the icons nor the interface for third party applications, however user friendliness and guidelines compliance is something being reviewed during the integration process. Therefore, a very poor design might be a cause of delay in your release roadmap if the outcome of the review is negative because of it. Don’t neglect it ! Design Warranty The design of your device app shall free from any encumbrances and shall not infringe upon any third party intellectual property right, in particular trademark and design rights. You grant Ledger the right to use such design for free with the right to reproduce and exploit the design for the duration of its display on Ledger website. You represent and warrant that the device app you are making available on Ledger Live is in compliance with all relevant laws and regulations. You agree to hold Ledger harmless of any claim arising out of the use of the design and or distribution of the device app . Release Process There are different release levels for a given application: Public release (official Ledger support) Developer mode release (experimental support) Developer mode with an audited application Developer mode with an unaudited application Warning In any case, Ledger&#39;s decision to publish a third party application may not be considered as any form of partnership nor endorsement of such. As long as an application isn’t audited by Ledger security team, the message Pending Ledger Review will be made visible when the application is started. The user can aknowledge and skip this warning by pressing both buttons and use the application at his own risks. As an unaudited application is considered experimental, such application will be visible only once the developer mode settings has been enabled in Ledger Live settings. Some applications are also visible once the developer mode setting is enabled, not because of a lack of security review, but rather because they are considered too complex to use. A reason might be a the mandatory compatible GUI is missing, or the application purpose is considered too technical for the vast majority of users. An application will be listed publicly (official Ledger support) once: It passed the security audit It’s been tested and validated by at least someone from Ledger Customer Success Team The application is compatible with a GUI companion app (CLI is not enough) Ledger is ready to communicate officially about the app release (tweet, blogpost, website page update) Customer support pages are available on Ledger Help Center Note Ledger releases new cryptocurrency apps for its devices whenever reviews, tests, and resources allow it. Applications are usually released on Tuesday or Wednesday. Third Party Applications Support Note The following only applies if you are adding support for a cryptocurrency and chose to build your own companion app. Ledger does not provide support for third party applications. It is required for third party teams to provide and host a complete tutorial that will guide users before the app is released on the Ledger Manager (please follow these guidelines). Along with your publication request, app sources and tutorial, please provide information that will allow the Ledger support team to redirect users to relevant support resources: Identity: Name, Surname, Legal Entity Point of Contact: URL, email address, phone number Note Name, surname and phone number are kept private and will be used only in case of emergency. Contact External developer teams are welcome on Ledger’s Developer Slack. This is the place to get technical support, to discuss Ledger’s tech stack, and more broadly to get in touch with us. Warranty and liability disclaimer The review and publication of third-party Ledger device applications (collectively “the Service”) are provided by Ledger on an “as-is” and “as-available” basis. The Service is subject to change without notice. Ledger disclaims all warranties of accuracy, non-infringement, merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. To the extent that Ledger makes any pre-release of Ledger device applications available to third-party developers, you understand that Ledger is under no obligation to provide updates, enhancements, or corrections, or to notify you of any changes that Ledger may make, or to publicly announce or introduce the Ledger device applications at any time in the future. To the extent not prohibited by applicable law, in no event will Ledger be liable for personal injury, or any incidental, special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages whatsoever, including, without limitation, damages resulting from delay of delivery, for loss of profits, data, business or goodwill, for business interruption, or any other commercial damages or losses, arising out of or related to this agreement or your use or inability to use the service.

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Ledger Manager is the service which centralizes the distribution of
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BOLOS &lt;/b_introduction&gt;</code> applications on Ledger devices. It is the
place where both Ledger’s apps and third party apps are distributed to
users. This document aims at explaining the procedure for a third party
app to be released on the Ledger Manager.</p>

<p><img src="../Images/manager.png" class="align-center" alt="The Ledger Manager" />&lt;figcaption aria-hidden="true"&gt;The Ledger Manager&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;</p>

<p>First, let’s see the typical end-to-end architecture of a BOLOS
application, in the case of an app for a cryptocurrency:</p>

<figure>
<img src="../Images/app_architecture.png" class="align-center" alt="End-to-end architecture of a BOLOS application" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">End-to-end architecture of a BOLOS application</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In this example, 3 pieces of software are required:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A BOLOS application, written in C, running on a Ledger device</li>
  <li>The companion app, with business logic and typically a GUI, running
on a computer or a phone connected to the Ledger device</li>
  <li>A transaction explorer that interfaces between the front-end and the
cryptocurrency daemon, running either locally (in the case of a full
node) or remotely (light wallet)</li>
</ol>

<p>If you’re not developing an app adding support for a cryptocurrency,
then you can ignore the 3rd piece. Depending on your use case, the
companion app might be a simple daemon or a command line tool, without a
GUI. <em>The companion app should always be compatible with Windows, MacOS
and Linux</em></p>

<figure>
<img src="../Images/bitcoin-live.png" class="align-center" alt="Ledger&#39;s main companion app: the Ledger Live" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Ledger's main companion app: the Ledger Live</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>When these pieces are ready for deployment, they must be sent to Ledger
for a security review. One of the things we’re going to do is review the
security of the BOLOS application code, and check that it functions as
intended in conjunction with its companion app. Here is a non-exhaustive
list of what we’re looking at during the review process:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Backdoors</li>
  <li>Buffer overflows</li>
  <li>Correct use of the device (for example, minimizing `NVRAM wearing
    <flash-memory-endurance>`)
</flash-memory-endurance>
  </li>
  <li>Correct use of the SDK</li>
  <li>Application stability, correct handling of errors</li>
  <li>Correct usability (see <a href="#design-guidelines">Design Guidelines</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Review time depends on Ledger’s available resources and code complexity.
The more unique and complex the code, the longer the review. Please note
that forks of supported BOLOS apps will require a new review. The
decision to reject or revoke an app is at Ledger’s sole discretion. We
will make our best efforts to provide a rationale for such decisions.
Upon fixing identified issues, app authors will be allowed to re-submit
their apps. A new all-in-one native app called <em>Ledger Live</em> has been
released on the 9th of July, 2018. This new platform will be open to
pull requests for adding support for new cryptocurrencies in the coming
months, <em>it is not available yet</em>. Currently, your best shot is to build
your own companion app with its own backend. It is less convenient for
users than a full integration to Ledger Live, but on the other hand, it
gives you more freedom on the design of the interface you want users to
see, and the way it will be implemented (Web app? Native app? It’s up to
you!).</p>

<h3 id="design-guidelines">Design Guidelines</h3>

<p>The design of your device app will be added to our website to inform
that your app is available. In that respect, we thank you to provide us
with the design in a format and with measurements that shall meet the
criteria communicated by our team.</p>

<p>There are 2 mandatory icons that should be provided for Ledger to
release an app:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Device icon, displayed on the Nano S dashboard</li>
  <li>The Manager icon, displayed in the Manager application list</li>
</ul>

<p>Below are the Adobe Illustrator templates for such icons, please respect
their guidance.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The color palette for Blue icons shall contain 16 colors maximum</li>
  <li>The icon file shall not contain any alpha channel</li>
  <li>In order to blend well with the Blue’s Dashboard background, the 4
rounded white corners of the blue icon shall be set to this RGB
value: #F9F9F9 (and not #FFFFFF)</li>
  <li>Nano X icons must be 14x14 px in size. Developers can create their
Nano X icons from the 16x16 px Nano S one with the following command
on Linux (it first requires to install the package <span class="title-ref">imagemagick</span>):
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">convert nanos_app_&lt;token&gt;.gif -crop 14x14+1+1 +repage -negate nanox_app_&lt;token&gt;.gif</code></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Click on each image to download the corresponding .ai file, and fill
them directly before sending them back. They should correspond to the
icons used to compile your app.</strong></p>

<p>Most of the time, Bolos apps expose few functionalities to the user.
However, despite this simplicity, it is still challenging to build a
user-friendly interface, because of the few inputs (only 2 buttons !)
and also because of the screen size which offer only 128*32 pixels.
Ledger provides some guidance to avoid third party developers to
reinvent the wheel.</p>

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

See the `BAGL Toolkit&lt;/u_display_management&gt;` for more
information on the BOLOS Application Graphics Library technical details.

</div>

<p>Even though the screen is small, you don’t want to bloat it with plenty
of tiny text to fit everything in a single time. Instead, multiple
successives screens are the way to go, with a configurable time interval
between each screen switch. Doing this allows you to split and segment
the information to display. It is also a good practice to inform the
user of what is the kind of information currently displayed, by giving
it a title. In some cases, even when the information is segmented by
type, there won’t be enough space for it to fit entirely on screen.
Rather than splitting this information in multiple screens, it is better
to use automatic scrolling display. Here is an example that sums it up:</p>

<figure>
<img src="../Images/scroll.gif" class="align-center" alt="Example: transaction confirmation screen" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example: transaction confirmation screen</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>On this example two pieces of information are shown: an amount of
bitcoins, and a destination address. The two screens are alternating
periodically until the user validates or cancel. A title is present to
describe each information. For the too-long-to-display destination
address, the automatic scrolling is used.</p>

<p>A few graphical pointers (glyphs) help users to make a link between the
right and left buttons and their effects. There are four principal
functions fulfilled by pressing buttons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Making a binary choice for a question asked by the device (1 button)</li>
  <li>Moving in a menu (1 button)</li>
  <li>Selecting a menu entry (2 buttons)</li>
  <li>Proceeding with a disclaimer (2 buttons)</li>
</ul>

<p>To propose a binary choice to the user, 2 glyphs representing the 2
choices should be placed on each side of the screen (a cross symbol to
cancel and a validation symbol to accept). You can display a question
and relevant information in between the glyphs, like in the upper
example.</p>

<p>To move inside a menu, be it vertical or horizontal, the same technique
is applied with different glyphs. We recommend using arrows: up and down
for a vertical menu, left and right for a horizontal one).</p>

<figure>
<img src="../Images/horizontal_menu.png" class="align-center" alt="Example use of arrows in an horizontal menu" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example use of arrows in an horizontal menu</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
<img src="../Images/vertical_menu.png" class="align-center" alt="Example use of arrows in a vertical menu" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example use of arrows in a vertical menu</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Once positioned on the right menu entry, the user can select the entry
by pressing both buttons. This potential action is not represented by
glyphs. Same goes when going through a set of disclaimer screens: only
text is displayed, and the user goes to the next part by pressing both
buttons. This is a consistent behavior across the device, so you can
assume that users are used to it. It should feel obvious when the user
has to press two buttons to go through something in your app.</p>

<p>Ledger does not impose the icons nor the interface for third party
applications, however user friendliness and guidelines compliance is
something being reviewed during the integration process. Therefore, a
very poor design might be a cause of delay in your release roadmap if
the outcome of the review is negative because of it. Don’t neglect it !</p>

<h3 id="design-warranty">Design Warranty</h3>

<p>The design of your device app shall free from any encumbrances and shall
not infringe upon any third party intellectual property right, in
particular trademark and design rights. You grant Ledger the right to
use such design for free with the right to reproduce and exploit the
design for the duration of its display on Ledger website.</p>

<p>You represent and warrant that the device app you are making available
on Ledger Live is in compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.</p>

<p>You agree to hold Ledger harmless of any claim arising out of the use of
the design and or distribution of the device app .</p>

<h3 id="release-process">Release Process</h3>

<p>There are different release levels for a given application:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Public release</strong> (official Ledger support)</li>
  <li><strong>Developer mode release</strong> (experimental support)
    <ul>
      <li>Developer mode with an <strong>audited</strong> application</li>
      <li>Developer mode with an <strong>unaudited</strong> application</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="warning">

<div class="title">

Warning

</div>

In any case, Ledger's decision to publish a third party application may
not be considered as any form of partnership nor endorsement of such.

</div>

<p>As long as an application isn’t audited by Ledger security team, the
message <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Pending Ledger Review</code> will be made visible when the
application is started. The user can aknowledge and skip this warning by
pressing both buttons and use the application at his own risks. As an
unaudited application is considered experimental, such application will
be visible <strong>only once the developer mode settings has been enabled</strong> in
Ledger Live settings.</p>

<p>Some applications are also visible once the developer mode setting is
enabled, not because of a lack of security review, but rather because
they are considered too complex to use. A reason might be a the
mandatory compatible GUI is missing, or the application purpose is
considered too technical for the vast majority of users.</p>

<p>An application will be listed publicly (official Ledger support) once:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It passed the security audit</li>
  <li>It’s been tested and validated by at least someone from Ledger
Customer Success Team</li>
  <li>The application is compatible with a GUI companion app (CLI is not
enough)</li>
  <li>Ledger is ready to communicate officially about the app release
(tweet, blogpost, website page update)</li>
  <li>Customer support pages are available on Ledger Help Center</li>
</ul>
