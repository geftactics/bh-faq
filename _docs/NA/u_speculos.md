## Introduction

Ledger has developed its own Ledger Nano S / Ledger Nano X / Ledger Blue
emulator, called [Speculos](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/speculos). This
emulator can be useful if you want to run tests, debug your app with
GDB, or just try your app without having to physically plug-in your
Ledger device.

We will go over a quick guide to using speculos, but more information is
available in [speculos dedicated
documentation](https://speculos.ledger.com/) or in the [docs section of
the github page](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/speculos/tree/master/doc).

### Setup

1.  Start by cloning the [official Speculos
    repo](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/speculos):

        git clone https://github.com/LedgerHQ/speculos

2.  Make sure you have the appropriate packages installed on your
    machine:

        sudo apt install qemu-user-static python3-pyqt5 python3-construct python3-jsonschema python3-mnemonic python3-pyelftools gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf libc6-dev-armhf-cross gdb-multiarch

3.  Build:

        cmake -Bbuild -H.
        make -C build/

Please note that the first build can take some time because a tarball of
OpenSSL is downloaded (the integrity of the downloaded tarball is
checked) before being built. Further invocations of `make` skip this
step.

The following command line can be used for a debug build:

    cmake -Bbuild -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -H.

### Usage

<div class="warning">

<div class="title">

Warning

</div>

Only run Speculos on trusted apps, as a malicious app could exploit it
and make arbitrary Linux system calls.

</div>

To run your application, simply type in:

    ./speculos.py /path/to/app.elf

You can then use your left / right arrows to emulate the left and right
buttons of your device.

### Communicating with the device

You can communicate with the emulated device using
[APDUs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_card_application_protocol_data_unit).
Speculos embbeds a TCP server (listening on `127.0.0.1:9999`) to
forwards APDUs to the target app.

In this example we will use the
[ledgerctl](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledgerctl) client that you can
install with `pip`:

    pip3 install ledgerwallet

If the environment variables `LEDGER_PROXY_ADDRESS` and
`LEDGER_PROXY_PORT` are set, the library ill try to use the device
emulated by Speculos. For instance, the following command-line sends the
APDU `e0 c4 00 00 00` (Bitcoin-app's APDU to request the version):

    $ ./speculos.py /path/to/app.elf &  ## First start the app in the background
    $ echo 'e0c4000000' | LEDGER_PROXY_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1 LEDGER_PROXY_PORT=9999 ledgerctl send -
    10:01:09.546:apdu: > e0c4000000
    10:01:09.547:apdu: < 6d00
    6d00

Other clients are available (ledgerblue, btchip-python...) and you will
find more information in [speculos'
doc](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/speculos/blob/master/doc/usage.md#clients).

### Debugging with GDB

Speculos can also be used to debug your code with GDB:

    ./speculos.py -d /path/to/app.elf &
    ./tools/debug.sh /path/to/app.elf

This command should start a brand new gdb instance with your app already
loaded !

### Debugging inside Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code users might be happy to learn that debugging through
the usual VSCode interface is made possible using speculos.

In your `.vscode` file, simply create a `launch.json` file containing
this:

    {
        "version": "0.2.0",
        "configurations": [
            {
                "type": "gdb",
                "request": "attach",
                "name": "Attach to gdbserver",
                "executable": "${workspaceFolder}/bin/app.elf",
                "target": ":1234",
                "remote": true,
                "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
                "valuesFormatting": "parseText",
                "gdbpath": "gdb-multiarch",
                "autorun": [
                    "set architecture arm",
                    "handle SIGILL nostop pass noprint",
                    "add-symbol-file ${workspaceFolder}/bin/app.elf 0x40000000",
                    "b *0x40000000",
                    "c"
                ]
            }
        ]
    }

Make sure you have [Native Debug's
extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=webfreak.debug)
installed. Then, follow these steps:

1.  Set a breakpoint (click on the left-hand side of the line you want
    to set a breakpoint on).
2.  In a new terminal, attach speculos (run
    `./speculos.py -d /path/to/app.elf`).
3.  In VSCode, press F5 to start the debugging session. You're good to
    go !

If your device is in a loop (if you get the error
`Cannot execute this command while the selected thread is running`),
then you probably need to send an APDU to the device to actually reach
the breakpoint you've set. Please refer to the [Communicating with the
device](#communicating-with-the-device) section.
