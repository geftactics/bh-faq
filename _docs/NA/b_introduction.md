## Introduction

This chapter contains detailed documentation about the core features
offered by BOLOS, and how they can be utilized by BOLOS applications and
end-users. We'll discuss how BOLOS manages the master device seed and
the device private key, and how it can be used for attestation purposes.
We'll also describe the hardware architecture that is common between all
BOLOS devices.
