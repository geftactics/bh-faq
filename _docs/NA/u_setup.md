Only Linux is supported as a development OS. For Windows and MacOS
users, a Linux VM is recommended.

Developing and / or compiling BOLOS applications requires the SDK
matching the appropriate device (the Nano S, X SDK or the Blue SDK) as
well as the following two compilers:

-   A standard ARM gcc to build the non-secure (STM32) firmware and link
    the secure (ST31) applications
-   A standard ARM clang above 7.0.0 with [ROPI
    support](http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.dui0491i/CHDCDGGG.html)
    to build the secure (ST31) applications
-   Download a prebuilt gcc from
    [here](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads)

### Setting up the Toolchain

The Makefiles used by our BOLOS applications look for gcc and clang
installations using the `PATH` environment variable.

If you don't want to install specific versions of clang and gcc directly
on your system, simply prepend their location in your `PATH` environment
variable.

``` bash
## GCC
PATH=~/bolos-devenv/gcc-arm-none-eabi-5_3-2016q1/bin:$PATH

## Clang
PATH=~/bolos-devenv/clang+llvm-7.0.0-x86_64-linux-gnu-ubuntu-16.04/bin:$PATH
```

Cross compilation headers are required and provided within the
gcc-multilib and g++-multilib packages. To install them on a debian
system:

``` bash
sudo apt install gcc-multilib g++-multilib
```

If you wish to load applications on your device, you will also need to
add the appropriate `udev` rules.

``` bash
wget -q -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LedgerHQ/udev-rules/master/add_udev_rules.sh | sudo bash
```

### Setting up the SDK

Now that you have your toolchain set up, you need to download / clone
the SDK for the appropriate Ledger device you're working with. Make sure
you checkout the tag matching your firmware version.

Ledger Nano S SDK: <https://github.com/LedgerHQ/nanos-secure-sdk>

Ledger Nano X SDK: <https://github.com/LedgerHQ/nanox-secure-sdk>

Ledger Blue SDK: <https://github.com/LedgerHQ/blue-secure-sdk>

Finally, link the environment variable `BOLOS_SDK` to the SDK you
downloaded.

``` bash
BOLOS_SDK='/path/to/sdk/'
```

When using the Makefile for our BOLOS apps, the Makefile will use the
contents of the SDK to determine your target device ID (Ledger Nano S, X
or Ledger Blue). Even if you aren't building an app, loading an app with
the Makefile still requires you to have the SDK for the appropriate
device linked to by `BOLOS_SDK`.

### Python Loader

Most apps use the Python loader, a Ledger-made Python library to
communicate with Ledger devices.

To install it, you will need to add a couple of extra dependencies:

``` bash
sudo apt install virtualenv libudev-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev
```

You will also need the `python-dev-tools` (aka `python-dev` on Python 2)
package

``` bash
python3 -m pip install python-dev-tools --user --upgrade
python3 -m pip install ledgerblue
```

If you need more information about the Python loader, feel free to check
out the github repo: <https://github.com/LedgerHQ/blue-loader-python> .
You should find what you're looking for in the `doc` folder and
`README.md` .

Now that you're setup and ready to go, you can start looking at our
`Writing Apps </u_writing_apps>` article!
