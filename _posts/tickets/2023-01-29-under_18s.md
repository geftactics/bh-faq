We offer three different ticket types for under 18s:

* Youth Ticket (age 13-17)
* Child Ticket (2-12) 
* Infant Ticket (under 2)

Anyone under the age of 18 will only be allowed entry to the festival with a 'Responsible Adult' (who has to be over the age of 25 and who can accompany up to a MAXIMUM of two under 18s). The Adult must arrive and enter the festival with the Youth(s), Child(s) or Infant(s)

To ensure compliance with our Child Protection Policy, there are some terms and conditions associated with buying Youth Tickets. Please check points 2 to 9 of the [terms and conditions](http://beatherder.co.uk/terms).


Ticket info for 2023 will be available via the [Beat-Herder tickets page](https://tickets.beatherder.co.uk/) from Thursday 6th October 2022
