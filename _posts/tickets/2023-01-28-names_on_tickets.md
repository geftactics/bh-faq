The full name of each ticket-holder is required when booking so that the wristband is linked directly to each individual, ensuring that if a wristband becomes lost, or broken during the event, getting a replacement is an easy process.

In recent years we have also seen an increase in attempts to enter the festival with stolen, resold and forged wristbands. This is something we take seriously and this process will make these attempts far more difficult.

All data collected during the buying process is securely handled and will only ever be used by Ticketline and/or Beat-Herder.
