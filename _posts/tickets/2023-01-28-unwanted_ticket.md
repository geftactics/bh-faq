No.

Ticketline have launched their own ticket exchange website - [Fanticks](https://www.fanticks.com/) - This is the only way we allow unwanted tickets to be sold on.

[Fanticks](https://www.fanticks.com/) have a system in place that verifies the sale between the two parties.

All tickets are now named and proof of ID is required on entrance, so please don't sell on tickets on other sites - the name on the ticket will be incorrect and entry will be refused
