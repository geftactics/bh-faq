Some people do get the train to either Skipton or Clitheroe and jump in a taxi from there. There is a drop-off/Pick-up area just inside the festival (don't get out on the main road!!).

Here are a few number to get you started:

* Minibuses and coaches - 01254 672338

* Clitheroe Taxis - 01254 888288

* Burnley Taxis - 01282 777247

* Accrington Taxis - 01254 388888
