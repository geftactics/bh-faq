The live-in vehicle area at Beat-Herder is just for 'proper' campervans and caravans.

We are sorry but we just don't have the space for cars and work vans and the extra congestion results in big delays getting off site on Monday morning.

Please don't spend the extra money on a live-In vehicle pass if you don't meet the criteria, as you will not be allowed within the specified area and you won't be able to set up camp in the car park either.
