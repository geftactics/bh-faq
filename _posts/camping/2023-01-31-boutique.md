Yes we do!

We have teamed up with our close friend Mr (Tommy) Thompson. He's a local tent maker and is offering the use of his bell tents and yurts as boutique accommodation at the festival - sited in their own exclusive compound, accessed only by those with special wristbands. The area will have hot showers and flushing toilets. Prices vary - depending on size and requirements.

For more info, check out the [Beatherder Glamping page](http://beatherder.co.uk/glamping)

For details about availability and to book any remaining boutique camping, contact [customerservices@ticketline.co.uk](customerservices@ticketline.co.uk) with your booking reference and request.
