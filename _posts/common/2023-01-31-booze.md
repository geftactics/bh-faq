Alcohol can ONLY BE BROUGHT IN ON YOUR 1st ENTRY WHEN YOU GET YOUR WRISTBAND. Once you have your wristband you cannot bring more into the festival.

Live in Vehicle pass holders - this is the limit to be taken into that area.

For 2023 you can bring in either up to 24 cans OR 1 box of wine (up to 5L) OR 1 bottle (not glass - maybe plastic or metal) of spirits (up to 1.5L).

You can drink it wherever you like on site. Oh and if you run out, our bars sell the cheapest and best booze on the festival calendar, and you can even earn free beer by keeping the place tidy.

Glass is NOT ALLOWED on site and will be confiscated, so please look for drinks in alternative packaging or decant your drinks before you leave home.
